# Project description
“Flood Help” is a mobile application designed for use during flooding events in the greater Brisbane region. Flood Help provides users the ability to view a real-time picture of potential hazards during flooding events and the status of their loved ones.

The 2022 floods in Brisbane had devastating effects on the community with some 20,000 homes flooded, numerous public services not available, and 13 people losing their lives as a result of the flooding. In a critical situation such as this, when safety is at stake, real time and reliable information is key. People must be able to make informed choices about safe routes to take, when to stay home, or even when it is time to evacuate. This need for information revealed a glaring problem with the current flood information systems in Brisbane, namely that there are almost no sources where users can go to find specific and fine grained information. Our user surveys revealed that residents struggled to obtain accurate and timely reports of hazards such as flooded roads or rising flood waters, often relying on questionable social media posts to attempt to find the information they need. Reports from services such as BOM were too broad or simply not available, and reliable information was scattered. 

Flood Help resolves this issue by providing an easy way for Brisbane residents to access a robust and centralised source of reliable information regarding ongoing or possible floods. Our app distinguishes itself from other current options by centralising information from official channels including Brisbane City Council and other reliable third party data sources, together with on the ground user reports where users can post photos and information about specific flood related hazards which others could use to take the necessary precautions.

Flood Help places an emphasis on presenting users reliable information. Users are provided a trustworthiness rating for each report which is calculated by corroborating them with other reports made nearby. If a large number of similar reports are made close to a report, then the report trustworthiness is increased. The use of images for reports additionally serves to help users gain a clear picture of the hazard. Information from official channels is also available, with the app providing real time weather warnings issued by the BOM, real time measurements of the height of various rivers, lakes and waterways in the region, and access to a map showing the historical risk of flooding in each area.

Another feature which makes Flood Help stand out is that it connects family members and friends, giving them the ability to see each other's location and track their safety status which is periodically updated. Users can also request another user to update their status. Our user interviews reveal that residents found it difficult to stay connected. In the chaos, people often missed phone calls from loved ones, or were not able to contact them. Flood Help provides real-time location tracking and status updates to address this.

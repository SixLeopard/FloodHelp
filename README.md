# Project Brief
### 12S: Flood Help - Enhanced Flood Preparedness and Response

Assistive Technology

Geographical Information Sharing
Real-time API Data Retrieval
Accessible for Vulnerable Groups

#### Project brief

FloodHelp is a mobile app that combines map functionality, API information acquisition, and user information sharing. It will provide users with comprehensive and timely local information support, enabling them to more effectively find the resources they need in emergency situations and ensure the safety of their families and communities. Efficient information acquisition, easy-to-understand presentation of information, and easy-to-use features must be considered.

#### Problem space

As global warming intensifies, Australia may experience more frequent extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall and river flooding. Enhancing flood risk management is therefore crucial. The 2022 floods exposed major issues, including low community awareness and preparedness for flood risks, and delays in official information reaching affected residents. Although residents often turn to social media for emergency updates, the reliability of this information is not always assured. Additionally, there are concerns about the accessibility of these platforms for elderly users and people with disabilities.

#### Success criteria

A mobile application that must provide users with timely updates about flood conditions that could impact them or their families at their current or future locations.

#### This project MUST have

A geolocation feature with high accuracy and fast information loading speed.
A function that accurately updates the locations of the user's family members in real-time and is able to send notifications to them.
An information-sharing feature that provides timely and accurate updates on the map, supported by a robust information verification mechanism.

#### This project COULD have

Users can customise alerts and notifications based on their preferences.
Basic functionality available offline, including downloaded maps and saved locations.

### Expected skills to have or develop

Proficiency in Swift (for iOS development) or Kotlin (for Android development), or using cross-platform frameworks such as Flutter or React Native.
Understanding how to integrate and use third-party APIs (such as weather APIs and flood warning APIs) in conjunction with maps.
High-level UI/UX design skills to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces, while also considering the needs of vulnerable groups.

can you generate me a html file that gives a modern minimal looking welcome page to my api
called FloodHelp API and can you turn this project outline "The project is to develop a mobile
application to provide users with real time updates about flood conditions in the Brisbane area.
It will feature a user interface displaying maps where users can view their location on the map,
hazards in the area, and the locations of their family members or selected people. Hazards are
reported by users by selecting a location, uploading an image of the hazard, and adding a title.
The map will also display risk zones in which a high number of hazard reports have been made,
where the number of reports indicate the likelihood of danger. This information will be used
in conjunction with information gathered from official sources such as Brisbane City Council, QLD Search
and Emergency Services, or QLD Police, to provide users with location specific information about flood 
conditions in their area" into a description of the project to include in page

            FloodHelp API is designed to provide real-time updates about flood conditions in the Brisbane area.
            Through the use of the api in the FloodHelp mobile app.
            It allows users to view their location on a map, identify nearby hazards, and track the locations of family members or selected individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can report hazards by selecting a location, uploading an image, and adding a title. 
            The app highlights high-risk zones based on the number of hazard reports, indicating areas of potential danger. 
            This crowdsourced information is combined with data from official sources, such as the Brisbane City Council and Queensland Emergency Services, 
            to give you accurate, location-specific flood updates.
